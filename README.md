## 🏃 How to Run
# Smarter Network Reconciliation and Anomaly Detection using Gen AI

# This project aims to automate the reconciliation of network device configurations and detect anomalies in network logs using Generative AI.

# **Project Overview:**

# 1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and formats raw network configuration and log data.
# 2.  **Configuration Reconciliation:** Uses Gen AI to generate embeddings of network configurations, enabling comparison and identification of differences.
# 3.  **Log Anomaly Detection:** Employs Gen AI to learn normal log patterns and detect deviations indicative of anomalies.

# **Usage:**

# 1.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
# 2.  Place raw network configuration and log files in the `data/raw` directory.
# 3.  Run the main script: `python src/main.py`
# 4.  Results are stored in `data/processed`.
1. Clone the repository  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ewfx/sradg-ai-tech-enthusiasts.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies  
   ```sh
   npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt (for Python)
   ```
3. Run the project  
   ```sh
   npm start  # or python app.py
   ```
